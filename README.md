**Implementing a cryptography agent and a secure hardware-based enclave to prevent computer hacking of client applications
Patent number: 12039057**

A cryptography agent is implemented to serve as an intermediary for a client application executing on an unsecured portion of a machine to bring greater hardware-based security to the client application. The cryptography agent does so by generating a public/private key pair for the client application and sealing the key pair inside an enclave that resides on a secured portion of the machine. The cryptography agent fetches confidential information for the client application from a secure server, where the confidential information is encrypted using the public key. The cryptography agent seals the confidential information using seal keys that are directly fused into hardware of the machine on which the enclave resides, which prevents the client application from accessing the confidential information in plaintext form. The client application sends commands to the cryptography agent, which performs operations within the enclave according to the commands once the client application is validated.

**Data migration framework**
Patent number: 11625368
Abstract: Methods and systems are presented for facilitating a data migration process between two data centers in an automated and secured manner. Based on detection of an event, a migration server initiates a data migration process for migrating data from a source data center to a destination data center. The migration server transmits instructions to a first migration application of the source data center, which causes the first migration application to retrieve the data, encrypt the data within an attested enclave of the source data center, and transfer the encrypted data to a pipeline. The migration server also transmits instructions to a second migration application of the destination data center, which causes the second migration application to retrieve the encrypted data from the pipeline, decrypt the encrypted data in an attested enclave of the destination data center, and store the decrypted data in a data storage of the destination data center.

**Auditable secure token management for software licensing/subscription**
Patent number: 11449582
Abstract: A method, apparatus, and system provide the ability to license a software application. A software application is used on a client computer. Usage information for the software application is acquired and is used to generate an original token that is encrypted. The encrypted token is forwarded to a server computer for licensing authentication and processing. The encrypted token is audited on the client computer by selecting and receiving the token from a licensing service, verifying the token, and displaying the result of the verifying.

**COMPACTING DATA BASED ON DATA CONTENT**
Publication number: 20160085766
Abstract: An example method for data compaction is disclosed in accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure. The method may include receiving, at a computing device, data files associated with an account. The method may also include determining, by the computing device, whether the account has expired. The method may also include, in response to determining that the account has expired, compacting, by the computing device, the data files associated with the account based on the content of the data files.

**Prohibiting electronic device usage based on geographical location**
Patent number: 8787941
Abstract: A system and method for prohibiting electronic device usage based on geographical location are provided herein. In examples, a geographical location of the electronic device is determined. Any policies associated with the geographical location of the electronic device are determined, and the policy may be obtained from a remote location. The functions of the electronic device are disabled based on the policy.

**ANALYZING A MESSAGE USING LOCATION-BASED PROCESSING**
Publication number: 20140181221
Abstract: Techniques for analyzing a message using location-based processing are described in various implementations. In one example implementation, a method may include receiving a message from a first user to a second user. The method may also include determining location information associated with the message, the location information including a first location associated with the first user, a second location associated with the second user, or both the first location and the second location. The method may also include determining, based on the location information, location-based processing to be applied when analyzing content of the message. The method may also include analyzing the content of the message to determine whether the message contains potentially unintended content using the location-based processing.

**Deterring electronic device usage under unsuitable conditions**
Abstract
A system and method for deterring electronic device usage under unsuitable conditions are provided herein. In examples, a position of the electronic device relative to the velocity source and a speed of the device is determined using hardware of the electronic device. Operation of the electronic device under unsuitable conditions is determined using the speed and position of the electronic device. An alert is issued when the electronic device is operated under unsuitable conditions.
